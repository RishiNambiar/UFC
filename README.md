# UFC
This program uses the Beautiful Soup library in python to web scrape the UFC website.

There are 3 functions to this program:
1) Looking up the current champions.
2) Entering any fighters name, to find their statistics.
3) Entering any UFC card and finding all the fights on that card with the details of each fight.

### Option 1: Looking up the current champions.
This option returns the champions of each division along with their nickname, weight, record and lastest fight.

### Option 2: Finding the details of any fighter.
On using this option, after entering the name of any fighter, a list of their details appear, these particular details change depending on the fighter, and how much information they have released. Some common details include:
Their status, record, hometown, age, weight, height, reach, leg reach octagon debut.

### Option 3: Finding the details of any UFC card.
After entering just the card number of the event you're interested to know the details of, the following details are displayed:
1) Division
2) Fighters
3) Winner of the fight
4) Round in which the fight ended 
5) Time the match ended at
6) Method of winning

Note: This third feature doesn't work for some cards, and I can't figure out why :(
